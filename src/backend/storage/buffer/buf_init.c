 * PGRAC MODIFICATIONS (14th, in InitBufferPool)
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Modified by: SqlRush <sqlrush@gmail.com>
 *
 * What changed (USE_PGRAC_CLUSTER guarded):
 *   InitBufferPool's per-buffer init loop calls
 *   ClusterInitBufferDescFields(buf) (defined inline in
 *   storage/buf_internals.h) to write placeholder values for the 17
 *   cluster fields (PCM lock state / CR chain / PI / Cache Fusion /
 *   GRD master cache).  The helper is also called from localbuf.c's
 *   InitLocalBuffers (PGRAC MODIFICATIONS 16th) so both shared and
 *   local buffer descriptor arrays get identical placeholder values.
 *
 * Why:
 *   Stage 1.6 lays the structural foundation; runtime semantics land
 *   later.  Explicit placeholder writes (CLAUDE.md 规则 8 实现完整性)
 *   prevent reliance on calloc / MemSet zero-fill -- three cluster
 *   fields (cr_chain_head / cr_chain_next / pi_buf_id) require
 *   INVALID_BUFFER_ID = -1 not 0 (0 is a valid buffer_id and would
 *   mislead Stage 3 CR-path reads).
 *
 * Spec: spec-1.6-buffer-descriptor.md §1.2 Deliverable 3.5 + §8 Q4 + Q5

/*
 * Data Structures:
 *		buffers live in a freelist and a lookup data structure.
 *
 *
 * Buffer Lookup:
 *		Two important notes.  First, the buffer has to be
 *		available for lookup BEFORE an IO begins.  Otherwise
 *		a second process trying to read the buffer will
 *		allocate its own copy and the buffer pool will
 *		become inconsistent.
 *
 * Buffer Replacement:
 *		see freelist.c.  A buffer cannot be replaced while in
 *		use either by data manager or during IO.
 *
 *
 * Synchronization/Locking:
 *
 * IO_IN_PROGRESS -- this is a flag in the buffer descriptor.
 *		It must be set when an IO is initiated and cleared at
 *		the end of the IO.  It is there to make sure that one
 *		process doesn't start to use a buffer while another is
 *		faulting it in.  see WaitIO and related routines.
 *
 * refcount --	Counts the number of processes holding pins on a buffer.
 *		A buffer is pinned during IO and immediately after a BufferAlloc().
 *		Pins must be released before end of transaction.  For efficiency the
 *		shared refcount isn't increased if an individual backend pins a buffer
 *		multiple times. Check the PrivateRefCount infrastructure in bufmgr.c.
